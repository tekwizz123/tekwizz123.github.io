Well I guess you could make that two fails now that I look back on this. First fail: I havn't been blogging nearly as much as I thought I would. Then again that might be a good thing considering how much time has been required for this lab and getting the info + hosts I have gotten so far.<br /><br />But so far is now only a relative term. Because guess what? I deleted my stuff.<br /><br />How?<br /><br />Here's how:<br /><br />rm -rf * (the directory I wanted to delete instead)<br /><br />Guess what that equates to? This:<br /><br />rm -rf *<br /><br />So poor little me lost about a good 70% of his work in about 10 seconds. Yay. Shall I give a little overview?<br /><br />Downsides:<br /><ul><li>Lost all scans and most of my notes.</li><li>Lost all my pictures.</li><li>All files downloaded from machines are now gone.</li><li>All dumped hashes are now gone.</li><li>The notes on the actual exploits for each machine are now gone.</li><li>Pretty much f***ing everything is now deleted or is not available to me.</li></ul><br />Plus Sides:<br /><ul><li>For some odd reason, shutter happens to save each photo that you take as a snapshot before you choose the save as button and save it elsewhere. So I still have all my photos, just in a different place.</li><li>My memory for things is good, so I should be able to remember most of the exploits for the various hosts.</li><li>Downloaded files are actually not that big of a problem. Most of them were just downloaded because I could, a few actually mattered though.</li><li>The outline format for the notes still exists, so I know what information needs to go where, I just have to get the info first.</li></ul><br />Yeah, so my 20-22 or so hosts that I exploited have to be redone again by hand. Double yay.<br /><br />/end rant<br /><br />In other news, I will be heading off to America soon to tour countries with my bro for colledge. Internet will be intermittent so if you have me on Skype just know that I won't be on very often. Because ontop of repairing all this damage I also have to try and wrap up the labs and exploit the last couple of hosts. To add to that I will also be traveling around quite a lot, and thus on those 6 hour car rides you can be sure as hell I won't have internet then.<br /><br />Anyway, just giving an update on what happened and giving you your daily lolz.<br /><br />-tekwiz123
