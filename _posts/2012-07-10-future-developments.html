This is more of a question than anything else for you guys.<br /><br />I'll probably be busy with PWB for the next few weeks until I get to college. In the mean time I'm interested in what you guys are interested in hearing from me.<br /><br />Here are some of my ideas:<br /><br />1. iOS Security (would have to be after PWB or around exam time due to time needed to setup and other things)<br />2. Daily Life and Thoughts<br />3. More fuzzing and exploitation info.<br />4. My life in colledge as I learn a hacking degree.<br />5. *Insert your item here*<br /><br />Leave a comment below and let me know what you think :)<br /><br />-tekwizz123
