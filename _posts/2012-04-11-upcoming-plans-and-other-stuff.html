So yeah sorry for the delay guys been busy getting stuff done for school (I do have a life outside of this you know :P )<br /><div><br /></div><div>Anyway as of yesterday I have been getting back to more security stuff and i'm happy to let you know that in a few weeks or so I'll be making a post on how to make your own fuzzer in Python and will be taking you step by step through the entire process. Expect this to take a little while as its going to take bit of time to try and explain everything and get it all down on paper.</div><div><br /></div><div>Expect lots of programming, some internal windows fuction calls and other stuff that generally will make an average mind spin XD Hehe im just playing with ya. So long as you have strong grasp of some programming language, you should be fine.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>In the meantime, here is a video of the finished fuzzer running in action by downloading the video from here (apparently SWF files aren't supported by youtube or many popular video sites.... :( &nbsp;:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.filedropper.com/firstpythonfuzzerinaction">http://www.filedropper.com/firstpythonfuzzerinaction</a></div>
