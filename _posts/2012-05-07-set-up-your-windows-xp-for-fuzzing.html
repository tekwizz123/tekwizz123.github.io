A little guide I found that you will need to follow before you can do the fuzzing tutorial which will post later (its in video fourm so I need to find a place that accepts .ogv files hehe. Not too many places that do that though so might have to convert it)<br /><br />Here you go:<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/OpenRCE/sulley/wiki/Windows-Installation">https://github.com/OpenRCE/sulley/wiki/Windows-Installation</a><br /><br />If you need&nbsp;a Windows XP box, you get one from following the steps mentioned in Offensive Security's Metasploit Unleashed course here: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Windows_XP_SP2_Setup">http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Windows_XP_SP2_Setup</a><br /><br />or just go torrent some random edition. Your choice. I don't care but you pay for what you get.<br /><br /><br />The tutorial should be up shortly :D
