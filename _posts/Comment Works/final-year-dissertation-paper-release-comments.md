From the US Commerce Department FAQ on Wassenaar - I suppose HMRC might just have applied a typical CYA interpretation when you asked:

Q: Doesnâ€™t the rule expose researchers to criminal prosecution if they carry information on exploits to a public conference, unless they publish it before the conference?

A: Under Section 734.7 of the EAR, information that is published, or released at an open conference, is not subject to the EAR. That section also specifies that it would not be an export to transfer the technical data to conference organizers with the intent that it will be published at the conference.

BIS welcomes comments on whether further clarification is needed on when information potentially subject to these rules would be considered "publicly available" and not subject to the EAR.
