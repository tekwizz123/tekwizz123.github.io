So, I know this is kinda late, but im now OSCP certified!<br /><br />I ended up staying up late one night (about 2 days back) and at like 3 am I check my email and see this:<br /><br />Congratulations, you have been certified :)<br /><br />*extra stuff here*<br /><br />blah blah blah<br /><br />you should get your certification mailed to you within 80 days.<br /><br />*my address and sensitive information here*<br /><br />end<br /><br />Yep :) So i should get it mailed to me soon. The only downside is that i will have to mail it to my parents first and then get it mailed to my colledge in england. Nothing I can really do about this unless I want further delays.<br /><br />Anyway, may or may not be active on here. Kinda busy getting ready for colledge atm + getting the mindset right. If you want to talk to me atm im pretty active on IRC. You can find me on the #offsec or #intern0t sections of Freenode.<br /><br /><br />Well i'll see ya guys around,<br /><br />-tekwizz123
