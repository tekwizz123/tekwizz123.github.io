Hey well seeing as this is my first post I think I might start out with something relatively simple and something that I have been looking into for quite a while: privacy.



Yep, that one thing that everyone tries to take away these days. Oh but don't worry, I'll show you a quick and easy way to get around all of that. May your problems \*click\*



go away.





Step 1: Getting the Browser

Okay we are going to need a new browser first off. And not just any browser, but one specifically created for the task. Enter JohndoFox. This little nifty browser does nearly everything it can to make you as anonymous as it can.



Get it here: [https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondofox.html](https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/jondofox.html)



Okay so the installation process should be pretty simple. If your on Linux instead of Windows (no, not Winblows you idiots...) type this:



\*command time mates, do this in a shell\*



wget https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/downloads/jondofox\_linux\_en.tar.bz2



tar -xvf jondofox\_linux\_en.tar.bz2



then it should be something like this (read the install file to make sure)



cd jondofox (or the name of the resulting directory from the above command)



./configure



make



make install



\*end command time\*



Let all that run or just click through the installer in Windows and let it set it all up with the defaults.



Step 2: Updating the Add-ons



Next thing we need to do is update the add-ons. While JohndoFox comes with some great add-ons, they will be out of date and will need to be individually updated so that you can use them. I'll wait for you to update each of them..........



still waiting........

.........



Step 3: Getting Extra Addons (Full list)



Okay so we have done pretty good so far. But we need a few more things to ensure total privacy. In an upcoming post I will show you how to use all of these brilliant tools. Here is as comprahensive a list as I can think up of. Let me know if you have more.



Ghostry

A great tool for opting out of tracking searches.

[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/) <- Click the download now there.



NoScript

This already comes with JohnDoFox, and allows you to disable scripts for certain sites. This is great cause not only do you have full control over what the page is loading, you can also allow certain scripts so that you can load certain content on a page without having to load, oh I don't know, \*cough cough\* Google Analytics \*cough cough\*.

[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/)



For more information on this vital tool see https://noscript.net



HTTPS Everywhere

Automatically enables HTTPS on every site that it can. This prevents your browser from sending data in plaintext where possible (doesn't work on all sites as some don't have a HTTPS option, but from personal experience most do these days)



[https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)



Again just click on Firefox and load the .xpi. You might have do double-click on it or in rare cases, go to your file manager and make sure that you chose "Open with Firefox". From there the installation is automatic.



Adblock Plus

Automatically blocks advertisements based on a list of known advertisers. Blocks pretty much every add that I know of minus maybe 1-2 so far. Really nice tool.

Cookie Monster

For managing cookies (if you know how to do so. I might make a tutorial about this if you guys want....just leave a comment asking for it and if enough people want it, I will make one)



[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-monster/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-monster/)





Thats all for now :) Let me know how it goes and remember to play safe with this.
