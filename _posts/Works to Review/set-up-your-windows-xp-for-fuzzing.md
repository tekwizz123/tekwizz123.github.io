A little guide I found that you will need to follow before you can do the fuzzing tutorial which will post later (its in video fourm so I need to find a place that accepts .ogv files hehe. Not too many places that do that though so might have to convert it)

Here you go:

If you needÂ a Windows XP box, you get one from following the steps mentioned in Offensive Security's Metasploit Unleashed course here:

[https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Windows\_XP\_SP2\_Setup](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Windows_XP_SP2_Setup)

or just go torrent some random edition. Your choice. I don't care but you pay for what you get.


The tutorial should be up shortly :D
