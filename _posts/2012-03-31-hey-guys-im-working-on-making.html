Hey guys I'm working on making a PyCommands post in a few days based on what I just learned off of the Grey Hat Python book I just learned so be patient as I don't want to directly copy the entire book and walk you though it that way (though if needed I could. Just saying ;) )<br /><br />Anyway in the meantime go check out&nbsp;<a href="http://chaturtha.blogspot.com/">http://chaturtha.blogspot.com/</a>&nbsp;. This guys a friend of mine and he's starting to post some rather awsome stuff on Web Security and Cryptography so if you want to see more stuff like what I post here go ahead and check his blog out.<br /><br />Cya all in a few days.<br /><br />Now where did those docs go...<br /><br />-tekwizz123
