title: About me
---

My name is Grant Willcox. I currently work for Rapid7 as a Metasploit Developer and Security Researcher.

In my previous jobs I have worked as:

- A Security Researcher for VerSprite
- An NDay Security Researcher for Exodus Intelligence
- A network and web security pentester for NCC Group
- A researcher for MWR Infosecurity (internship).

My interests mainly revolve around the area of vulnerability research and discovery, particularly in the area of the Windows Kernel, however lately I've been expanding my skill base and also looking into vulnerabilities in enterprise applications, particularly web applicaitons, more and more.

Some of my more interesting research recently has included porting SharePoint vulnerabilities into Metasploit, porting Windows LPEs into Metasploit, assisting on GSoC 2022, and developing new features for Metasploit Framework (still private atm, details to come).

When I'm not working you can find me at the local store playing some board games with the local folks, playing volleyball, watching/reading manga, or playing video games. I also enjoy hunting for good local food spots n sparring in BJJ, though since COVID hit I haven't had as much of chance to do this lately.
